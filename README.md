# Python-Notebooks
Python notebooks for ML process flow 
## The Repository

The following repository consists of notebooks for various Machine Learning algorithms. The notebooks are classified on the basis of different objectives; such as:<br>
1. EDA
2. Pre-processing
3. Pre-modelling
4.  a. Classification<br>
    b. Regression<br>
    c. Text Classification<br>
    d. Time Series<br>
5. Post Modelling

Each of these eight notebooks contain a number of methods along with their brief description and standard codes. These have been provided for both Python and R languages; present in the respective folders above. Inside each of these two folders the following have been provided:<br><br>
1. **The dataset folder:** Contains all the datasets that have been used in the notebook codes. You might cosider downloading these before proceeding or download them as per                                your requirement. The datasets can also be downloaded using the links that have been provided in the notebooks. 
2. **The notebook folders:** There are eight notebook folders in each of the two folders for Python and R. The contents inside the notebook folders are as follows:<br>
    2.a **.ipynb files:** These are notebooks that can be downloaded and used as required.<br>
    2.b **READ.md files:** These READ.md files would walk you through the contents of the notebook. It has been provided to allow you to visualize the contents of the .ipynb                                files.<br>
3. **README.md:** To give a clear idea of which notebooks contains the content that is searched for a readme file has been provided with the index of all the topics inside the                     notebooks. Please go through these topics and download the notebook accordingly.<br>
4. **The Image folder:** Contains all the images of the Notebooks. The images will be available in the .ipynb notebooks after download and the image folder is only used for                              importing the images to the corresponding README.md files.
